					<h2 style="font-size: 70px;">SQL Databases</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Data is stored in database tables by following a strict data schema (= structure)</li>
						<li class="fragment">Data is distributed across multiple tables which are connected via relations</li>
			    	</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
	                	SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it therefore is not a database itself but only a query language you can use to interact with a specific type of database.
                        SQL allows you to store, update, delete and of course retrieve data from relational database management systems (RDBMS).
						You can't add records which don't adhere to this schema. Got more fields? Sorry, you have to pick another table. Missing some field data? Not your table then!

					<ul>
						<img src="./img/the-problem-with-structured-data.jpeg" alt="the problem with structured data">
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
	                	The problem with a structured database is that it can become too structured and require a lot of resources to create and design a good database. 
						Just to show one example of this, what if we have a table that defines some structure and for a specific row we want to have some extra data?
						This is not easily done with a relational database.

					<h2 style="font-size: 70px;">NoSQL Databases</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">No schemas</li>
						<li class="fragment">No relations</li>
			    	</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
	                	 There is a core difference: You can put data of different structure into the same collection. You couldn't do that in the SQL world - each table had a clear schema there.

						<img src="./img/typesnoSQL.png" alt="sql-schema">
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
	                	 There are 4 basic types of NoSQL databases:<br>
                         1. Key-Value Store – It has a Big Hash Table of keys & values.<br>
                         2. Document-based Store- It stores documents made up of tagged elements.<br>
                         3. Column-based Store- Each storage block contains data from only one column.<br>
                         4. Graph-based-A network database that uses edges and nodes to represent and store data.

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
	                	 MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents. BSON is a binary representation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.
						 MongoDB documents are composed of field-and-value pairs and have the following structure:
                         The value of a field can be any of the BSON data types, including other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents.

						<img src="./img/MySQL vs MongoDB.png" alt="terminology difference">
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
	                	 The _id field represents a unique value in the MongoDB document. <br>
						 Collection – This is a grouping of MongoDB documents.<br>
                         Database – This is a container for collections like in RDMS wherein it is a container for tables.<br>
						 Document - A record in a MongoDB collection is basically called a document. <br>
						 Field - A name-value pair in a document.

	                	 1.  Download MongoDB. <br>
						 2.  Click recommended installation.<br>
                         3.  When you extract the download, there is going to be a bin folder.  Inside of this bin folder there are two important files: mongo, and mongod. Mongod is the server, mongo is how we communicate to this server.<br>

						 Run this command to create a database: use databasename. <br>
                         This will create the database and set it to be the active database.

	                	  You can use the following commands to query the data in MySQL database- ‘SELECT’, ‘UPDATE’, ‘INSERT’ and ‘DELETE’.
                          Let’s have a quick comparison.

					<h2>The speed of MySQL and MongoDB for 1000000 records</h2>
					<ul>
						<img src="./img/speed.png" alt="speed">
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
	                	  Let’s take a general example to understand the speed of MySQL and MongoDB in accordance with various functions.
                          Measurements have been performed in the following cases: MySQL 5.7.9 and MongoDB 3.2.0. 
						  Each of these has been tested on a separate m4.xlarge Amazon instance with the ubuntu 14.4 x64 and default configurations, all tests were performed for 1000000 records.
						  It is evident from the above graph that MongoDB takes way more lesser time than MySQL for same commands. And this must have answered your question: how fast is MongoDB compared to MySQL!

					<h2 style="font-size: 70px;">When to use MongoDB?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">When you need high availability of data with automatic, fast and instant data recovery.</li>
						<li class="fragment">If you have an unstable schema and you want to reduce your schema migration cost.</li>
						<li class="fragment">If you don’t have a Database Administrator.</li>
						<li class="fragment">If most of your services are cloud-based, MongoDB is best suitable for you, as its native scale-out architecture enabled by ‘sharding’ aligns well with horizontal scaling and agility offered by cloud computing.</li>

					<ul>
